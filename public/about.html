      <h2>What is Call to Roll?</h2>
      <p>
        Call to Roll is a free, open-source web application that lets you roll dice with friends in real-time.
        Whether you're playing tabletop RPGs, board games, or just need a fair way to make decisions,
        Call to Roll provides a simple and reliable solution.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>No accounts, no downloads, no hassle. Just create a room, share the code, and start rolling.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Multiple dice types:</strong> d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100</li>
        <li><strong>Customizable sets:</strong> Create up to 4 dice sets with different colors</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time sync:</strong> Everyone sees rolls instantly</li>
        <li><strong>Dice locking:</strong> Set aside dice between rolls for games like Yahtzee</li>
        <li><strong>Roll history:</strong> Track all rolls with timestamps and player names</li>
        <li><strong>Works everywhere:</strong> Desktop, tablet, or mobile - no app required</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Call to Roll uses peer-to-peer technology (WebRTC) to connect players directly to each other.
        This means your dice rolls are synchronized instantly between all players without going through
        a central server. The result is a fast, reliable, and private gaming experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our signaling server only helps players find each other to establish the initial connection.
        Once connected, all game data flows directly between players.
      </p>

      <h2>Perfect For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tabletop RPGs:</strong> D&D, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, and more</li>
        <li><strong>Board games:</strong> Any game that needs dice rolling</li>
        <li><strong>Remote gaming:</strong> Play with friends across the world</li>
        <li><strong>Quick decisions:</strong> Fair random number generation</li>
        <li><strong>Classroom activities:</strong> Games and probability lessons</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Open Source</h2>
