      <p class="subtitle">How we handle your information</p>
    </header>

    <div class="static-content">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Call to Roll is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data and never sell or share
        your information with third parties. This policy explains what data we handle and how.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>In short: We don't collect personal information, don't use tracking cookies, and don't
          share any data with third parties.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
      <p>Call to Roll does NOT collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal information (email, address, phone number)</li>
        <li>Account or login credentials (we don't have accounts)</li>
        <li>Payment information</li>
        <li>Tracking or advertising cookies</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Information Stored Locally</h2>
      <p>
        Call to Roll stores the following data in your browser's local storage (on your device only):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Display name:</strong> The name you enter is saved locally for convenience so
          you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data never leaves your device and can be cleared at any time by clearing your browser's
        local storage or site data.
      </p>

      <h2>Information Transmitted During Use</h2>
      <p>When using Call to Roll, the following information is transmitted:</p>

      <h3>To Our Signaling Server</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Room code:</strong> The 4-digit room identifier</li>
        <li><strong>Display name:</strong> Your chosen display name</li>
        <li><strong>Connection data:</strong> Technical information needed to establish peer connections (ICE candidates, session descriptions)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data is only used to connect players and is not stored permanently.</p>

      <h3>To Other Players (Peer-to-Peer)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Display name:</strong> Shown to other players in the room</li>
        <li><strong>Dice rolls:</strong> Your roll results are shared with other players</li>
        <li><strong>Game state:</strong> Which dice you're holding, lock status, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data flows directly between players using WebRTC peer-to-peer connections and does not
        pass through our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>Server Logs</h2>
      <p>
        Our signaling server may log technical information for operational purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connection timestamps</li>
        <li>Error messages for debugging</li>
        <li>Basic request metadata</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These logs do not contain personal information and are automatically deleted after a short
        retention period.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Call to Roll does not use cookies for tracking or advertising. We only use browser local storage
        to remember your display name preference.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Call to Roll does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
        We do not share any data with third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        All connections to our signaling server use HTTPS encryption. Peer-to-peer connections
        between players use DTLS encryption provided by WebRTC. We implement reasonable security
        measures to protect the limited data we handle.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Call to Roll does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The service does
        not require any personal information to use.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear your locally stored data at any time through your browser settings</li>
        <li>Use the service without providing any personal information</li>
        <li>Request information about what data we have (though we collect minimal data)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Significant changes will be noted on this
        page with an updated date. Continued use of Call to Roll after changes constitutes acceptance
        of the updated policy.
